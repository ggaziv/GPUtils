# General Purpose Utilities
These are commonly used tools or functions that you put together which could benefit everyone.

- utils1: Stand alone functions/objects that you can just import and run. If this file becomes too long please start a new one.

- startup_guyga: This is a startup script that I use for any startup of IPython (Jupyter ntbk included).
    It does some basic imports that make python environment more ready to use like MATLAB.
