# General Purpose Utilities
These are commonly used tools or functions that make up my standard coding desk.

- utils1: Stand alone functions/objects that you can just import and run. If this file becomes too long please start a new one.

- startup_guyga: This is a startup script that I use for any startup of IPython (Jupyter ntbk included).
    It does some basic imports that make python environment more ready to use like MATLAB.

- utils_torch: Utility functions that I regularly use for PyTorch programing.

- dataset_dumper: Utility that dumps a PyTorch dataset to disk (instead of holding it in RAM).

- cluster_batch_comp: Package for cluster parallel computing of tasks.
